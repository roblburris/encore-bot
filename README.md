Encore: Developed by Robert Burris (github.com/roblburris)
Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms with over 200 million (~100 million paid) users throughout the world. Likewise, Discord, a popular chat platform boasts over 200 million users to which Discord and Spotify have partnered to allow users to do things like set their statuses to reflect what they are listening to on Spotify. Even with this powerful partnership, there appears to be a lack of functionality that allow for users to share songs and find new artists on Spotify with other users. To solve this problem, I decided to write a Discord bot (an automated user that returns information when a normal user pings it) in Python that makes use of the Spotify and Discord APIs to allow users to search songs, tracks, and artists on Spotify and return the results in Discord. As such, Encore makes it simple to share music and view Spotfy Popularity Analytics on their favorite songs and artists.
